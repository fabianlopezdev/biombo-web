# Comprehensive Test Checklist for Refactored Scripts

## Overview
This checklist covers all functionality that has been refactored to ensure nothing is broken and everything works as expected.

## Critical Testing Areas

### 1. Page Navigation & Cleanup
- [ ] Navigate between pages using browser back/forward buttons
- [ ] Navigate between pages using internal links
- [ ] Check browser console for any memory leak warnings
- [ ] Verify no duplicate event listeners after multiple navigations
- [ ] Check that scripts properly reinitialize after navigation

### 2. Project Filters (Projects Page)

#### Desktop Testing
- [ ] Click "All" filter - should show all projects
- [ ] Click individual service filters - should filter projects correctly
- [ ] Click multiple service filters - should show projects matching ANY selected service
- [ ] Verify active filter styling is applied correctly
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation (Tab + Enter/Space) on filter pills
- [ ] Verify "Delete filters" button clears all active filters
- [ ] Test URL parameter filtering (add `?service=servicename` to URL)
- [ ] Check that filter state persists when scrolling

#### Mobile Testing
- [ ] Test filter pill horizontal scrolling by dragging
- [ ] Verify dragging doesn't trigger filter selection
- [ ] Check filter pills are properly contained in viewport
- [ ] Test touch interactions vs mouse interactions

#### Accessibility
- [ ] Test with screen reader - filter changes should be announced
- [ ] Verify ARIA labels and roles are present
- [ ] Check keyboard-only navigation works completely

### 3. Horizontal Scrolling (Homepage)

#### Desktop Testing
- [ ] Scroll down with mouse wheel - should scroll horizontally
- [ ] Scroll up when at top - should scroll horizontally backward
- [ ] Verify scrolling stops at container boundaries
- [ ] Check that vertical scrolling works normally outside container
- [ ] Test with different mouse wheel speeds
- [ ] Resize window - verify header height recalculation

#### Mobile Testing (width < 992px)
- [ ] Verify horizontal scroll is disabled on mobile
- [ ] Check normal vertical scrolling works

### 4. Magnetic Cursor (Project Tiles)

#### Desktop Testing
- [ ] Hover over project tiles - custom cursor should appear
- [ ] Move cursor near center - should have magnetic pull effect
- [ ] Click on project - should show click animation
- [ ] Test cursor follows correctly during horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Verify cursor hides when leaving project bounds
- [ ] Check cursor text/image appears after delay
- [ ] Test rapid hover in/out doesn't cause flickering

#### Touch Devices
- [ ] Verify magnetic cursor is completely disabled on touch devices
- [ ] Check no console errors on touch interactions

### 5. About Page Slider

#### Navigation
- [ ] Click previous/next arrows - slides should change
- [ ] Verify first slide disables previous arrow
- [ ] Verify last slide disables next arrow
- [ ] Check progress indicator updates correctly

#### Drag Functionality
- [ ] Drag slider left/right to change slides
- [ ] Test momentum scrolling after drag
- [ ] Verify snap-to-slide behavior
- [ ] Check drag works on both desktop and mobile

#### Progress Bar
- [ ] Verify progress bar reflects current slide
- [ ] Check ARIA attributes update with slide changes
- [ ] Test that progress bar is clickable to jump to slides

### 6. Back to Top Button (Footer)
- [ ] Click "Back to top" link in footer
- [ ] Verify page scrolls smoothly to top
- [ ] Check horizontal container resets to beginning
- [ ] Test on pages with and without horizontal scroll
- [ ] Verify it works after page navigation

### 7. Contact Form Textarea
- [ ] Type in auto-expanding textarea
- [ ] Verify it expands as content grows
- [ ] Check it respects max-height from CSS
- [ ] Test with pre-filled content
- [ ] Verify scroll position doesn't jump while typing
- [ ] Test copy/paste of large text blocks

### 8. Project Cards Filter (Projects List Component)
- [ ] Click filter buttons - projects should filter correctly
- [ ] Verify "All" filter is active by default
- [ ] Test multiple filter selections
- [ ] Check filter state doesn't interfere with Projects Page filters

### 9. Performance Testing
- [ ] Open browser DevTools Performance tab
- [ ] Record while interacting with all features
- [ ] Check for:
  - [ ] No memory leaks (memory should plateau)
  - [ ] Smooth 60fps animations
  - [ ] No excessive reflows/repaints
  - [ ] Event handlers are properly throttled

### 10. Error Handling
- [ ] Check browser console for any errors during normal use
- [ ] Test with slow network (DevTools Network throttling)
- [ ] Try rapid clicking/interactions
- [ ] Test with JavaScript disabled (graceful degradation)
- [ ] Verify all console warnings are intentional

### 11. Cross-Browser Testing
Test all above features in:
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Chrome Mobile (Android)

### 12. Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with very long project names
- [ ] Test with no projects/items to filter
- [ ] Test rapid page navigation
- [ ] Test with browser zoom (50%, 150%, 200%)
- [ ] Test with reduced motion preference enabled
- [ ] Test after browser refresh (F5)
- [ ] Test with multiple browser tabs open

## Regression Testing

### Features That Should Still Work
- [ ] All original filtering functionality
- [ ] All animations and transitions
- [ ] All hover/active states
- [ ] Mobile responsive behavior
- [ ] Accessibility features
- [ ] SEO meta tags and structured data
- [ ] Image lazy loading
- [ ] External links opening in new tabs

### Console Checks
Run these commands in browser console and verify no errors:
```javascript
// Check for memory leaks
performance.memory

// Check for duplicate listeners
getEventListeners(document)

// Check state manager
stateManager.keys()

// Check cleanup registry
cleanupRegistry.size
```

## Performance Benchmarks
Expected performance metrics:
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive: < 3.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: < 0.1
- No memory leaks after 5 minutes of use
- Smooth 60fps for all animations

## Notes for Testing
1. Clear browser cache before testing
2. Test in incognito/private mode to avoid extensions
3. Use realistic content (not lorem ipsum)
4. Test with actual production data if possible
5. Document any issues with steps to reproduce

## Sign-off
- [ ] All tests passed
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility confirmed
